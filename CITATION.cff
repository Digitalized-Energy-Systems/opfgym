abstract: >-
  The OPF-Gym library allows for easy creation of
  reinforcement learning (RL) environments for solving the
  optimal power flow (OPF) problem. OPF-Gym also provides
  five benchmark environments to ensure comparability of
  future RL-OPF research. Various kinds of OPF problems are
  supported, for example, multi-stage OPF, discrete actions,
  stochastic OPF, etc. Further, it is possible to generate
  labeled training data for supervised learning, which again
  improves comparability of research advances.
